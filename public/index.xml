      <description>Introduction This tutorial will show you how to create a simple theme in Hugo. I assume that you are familiar with HTML, the bash command line, and that you are comfortable using Markdown to format content. I&amp;rsquo;ll explain how Hugo uses templates and how you can organize your templates to create a theme. I won&amp;rsquo;t cover using CSS to style your theme.
We&amp;rsquo;ll start with creating a new site with a very basic template.</description>

      <description>Hugo uses the excellent go html/template library for its template engine. It is an extremely lightweight engine that provides a very small amount of logic. In our experience that it is just the right amount of logic to be able to create a good static website. If you have used other template systems from different languages or frameworks you will find a lot of similarities in go templates.
This document is a brief primer on using go templates.</description>

      <title>Migrate to Hugo from Jekyll</title>

      <description>Move static content to static Jekyll has a rule that any directory not starting with _ will be copied as-is to the _site output. Hugo keeps all static content under static. You should therefore move it all there. With Jekyll, something that looked like
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ images/ logo.png  should become
▾ &amp;lt;root&amp;gt;/ ▾ static/ ▾ images/ logo.png  Additionally, you&amp;rsquo;ll want any files that should reside at the root (such as CNAME) to be moved to static.</description>

      <title>Project 2: Horse Colic</title>

      <description>Melodie Irvin, mki77
Colic is a cause for many horse emergencies in veterinary medicine due to the severity of the abdominal obstructions that may occur. Colic itself is not a diagnosis, but rather a symptom of a larger problem that is usually found in the Gastrointestinal tract. This dataset, found on Kaggle, consists of different parameters measuring the health of 209 horses with colic. The main variables I will be focusing on are surgery (yes or no), outcome (lived or died), abdomen, total protein, and packed cell volume.</description>

      <description>Virology has always excited me, and with the coronavirus looming around everywhere we go, I found it compelling to compare the current data regarding the deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19 with it’s sister virus, SARS-CoV from 2003. Considering they are of the same genus and species of virus, I was expecting to find similar results regarding the number of deaths and rate of infection. As you will see, that is not at all the case.</description>
