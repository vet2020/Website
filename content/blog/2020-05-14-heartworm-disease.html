<p>Hello there. This postâ€™s purpose serves to emphasize the importance of having your pets on heartworm prevention. Before moving back to Austin, I worked in a small animal clinic in San Antonio in which I had the pleasure of looking after cats and dogs. One of my objectives as a veterinary technician assistant was to instruct owners on the benefits of different kinds of vaccines, the importance of heartworm tests once a year, and most importantly, the need for heartworm prevention. Now, unfortunately, heartworm tests really only serve to benefit dogs as there is no cure or treatment for heartworm disease in cats thus far. The only treatment for cats is to treat some symptoms (such as cough). So, let me tell you about the of a common disease called Heartworms. Your cat, dog, and ferret friends can all get heartworm disease.</p>

<p>Indeed. Heartworms, or <em>Dirofilaria immitis</em>, are tramitted by infected mosquitoes. When an infected mosquito bites a dog, cat, or ferret, it injects haertworm larvae into the hosts blood stream. These larvae grow, and when just large enough, can be seen under a blood smear (these baby heartworms are called <em>microfilariae</em>).</p>
<p>An example of a bloodsmear with a moving <em>microfilariae</em> can be seen below:</p>
