<p>Hello there. This postâ€™s purpose serves to emphasize the importance of having your pets on heartworm prevention. Before moving back to Austin, I worked in a small animal clinic in San Antonio in which I had the pleasure of looking after cats and dogs. One of my objectives as a veterinary technician assistant was to instruct owners on the benefits of different kinds of vaccines, the importance of heartworm tests once a year, and most importantly, the need for heartworm prevention. Now, unfortunately, heartworm tests really only serve to benefit dogs as there is no cure or treatment for heartworm disease in cats thus far. The only <em>treatment</em> for cats is to treat the symptoms themselves (such as a cough). So, let me tell you about the pitfalls of heartworm disease and how you can help prevent your pet (dog, cat, ferret) from ever getting them!</p>

<p>Indeed. Heartworms, or <em>Dirofilaria immitis</em>, are tramitted by infected mosquitoes. When an infected mosquito bites a dog, cat, or ferret, it injects heartworm larvae into the hosts blood stream. These larvae grow, and when just large enough, can be seen under a blood smear (these baby heartworms are called <em>microfilariae</em>).</p>
<p>An example of a bloodsmear with a moving <em>microfilariae</em> can be seen below:</p>

<p>It takes about six to seven months for the <em>microfilariae</em> to grow into adult heartworms during which time they find their way into the heart and lungs. There are four stages of disease in dogs, with the first having the pet exhibit no symptoms or an occasional cough. Stage two keeps the occasional cough but adds tiredness after moderate activity. This varies with breed type and age, so I would keep an eye on it and mention anything that seems unusual to your vet. For stage three of heatworm disease, teh dog has become weak and frail, it has a distended stomach, trouble breathing, and tiredness after moderate activity. At this point Radiographs, or X-rays, can show the extent of damage done to the heart and lungs. The final stage (stage four) is called Caval syndrome. If heartworms get to this point, there is almost no blood flow occuring due to the excessive amount of worms. Typically, a dog with heartworms has between one and fifteen, but can get up to over 250.</p>

<p>Symptoms of heartworm disease in cats include but may not be limited to: vomiting, weight loss, decreased activity and appetite, trouble breathing, coughing, and an increased respiratory rate.Now, contrary to some beliefs, heartworm disease can be transmitted year-round.There are a few options for heartworm prevention for both dogs and cats and any of them are good, but Revolution for cats or dogs can <em>off-label</em> get rid of ear mites.The most important thing to rememberis to keep your pets on heartworm preventatives and not miss a day of prevention!</p>
